//! Which frequency a replacement front end should be opened at.
//!
//! One decision, in one place, because three different paths open a radio —
//! the program starting up, the operator pressing the link button, and the
//! background reconnect — and the bug this answers for all three at once was
//! that only the first of them knew about it.
//!
//! The reported case (#72) is a start frequency the hardware cannot reach: an
//! I.F. offset saved as a frequency, so the tuner is asked for 6 GHz, refuses,
//! and the operator has to correct the number by hand before anything opens.
//! The one thing worth doing about that is to open at a frequency the radio has
//! already proved it can tune.

/// Whether `hz` is a frequency this program may hand to an open attempt: a
/// real, positive number of hertz. A zero, a negative and a damaged file's NaN
/// are all "no frequency was ever recorded", not a place to tune to.

///
/// `refused_hz` is the centre the last attempt at *this* radio failed on, and
/// `last_good_hz` a frequency the radio is known to have tuned. A substitution
/// happens only when the radio has refused this exact centre; what is offered
/// in its place is, in order:
///
/// - the recorded frequency, when it is a real one that is **not** the one being
///   refused — a fallback to the number that just failed is the retry that has
///   already failed, which is how a station ended up correcting the same
///   unreachable start frequency by hand every single morning; and failing
///   that,
/// - the first of `memories` that is a real frequency.
///
/// **The memories are the operator's own list, and they are the only honest
/// source left.** A record that is the refused number means the last run never
/// tuned anything — which is exactly what happens to a station whose start
/// frequency could not be reached, since the stand-in it runs on answers every
/// tune with "done". Guessing a band centre there would move a satellite
/// listener's dial to a frequency nobody chose; their own stored channels are
/// frequencies they put there on purpose.

/// open at 145.0000004 MHz after a refusal at 145.0 MHz is the same request.
