//! DAB / DAB+ — Digital Audio Broadcasting.
//!
//! The OFDM digital radio band, in **Band III** (174–240 MHz) and L-band. A
//! **wideband** service like ADS-B: a Mode I ensemble is about 1.536 MHz of
//! occupied spectrum, so it is decoded from its own lane of raw I/Q rather than
//! the 12 kHz tap the narrow modes share, and the panel is a service list
//! rather than a waterfall of audio.
//!
//! This module holds only the wire/persisted shape — the band table, the
//! settings and the status the panel draws. The decoder itself is the
//! `sdroxide-dab` crate, which wraps the MIT `dabradio` library and decodes
//! DAB+ audio through the stock faad2 the binary already carries.
