//! The DAB / DAB+ panel: the ensemble, and the services it carries.
//!
//! A service list is the whole of what an operator does with DAB — tune a
//! channel, see what is on it, pick a station — so that is the panel. Received
//! audio plays through the ordinary speaker path, so there is no waveform to
//! draw here.
//!
//! The header says what the receiver is doing, for the reason the ADS-B panel's
//! does: an empty list has several quite different causes — a quiet channel, a
//! receiver not tuned to Band III, a stream too narrow to hold an ensemble — and
//! only one of them is anything to do with the decoder.
