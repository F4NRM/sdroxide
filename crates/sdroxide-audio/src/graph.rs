//! The PipeWire side of the device list.
//!
//! **Why this exists.** sdroxide asks ALSA for its sound devices, and ALSA
//! cannot see a PipeWire graph. It exposes a *bridge* — a `pipewire` and a
//! `pulse` PCM — and nothing behind it. So a Bluetooth microphone, a virtual
//! sink, a loopback or anything else a listener has arranged in a patchbay **can
//! never appear in the settings list by name**, however long anyone looks, while
//! the patchbay shows it plainly. Both observations are correct; they are
//! different floors of the same building.
//!
//! The Bluetooth microphone is what forced the question (`BT-MIKE-HANDOVER.md`),
//! but nothing here is about Bluetooth: this is a *device list* that can see the
//! sound server the operator actually uses.
//!
//! **How a graph node is opened.** A PipeWire node is not a device you open and
//! close. It is reachable two ways, and both are tried, in order:
//!
//! 1. **By name through the bridge** — `pulse:<node>`, which the ALSA `pulse`
//!    plugin resolves. This is what makes a node *pickable*: the operator chooses
//!    `bluez_input.…` and sdroxide opens that node, rather than the node being
//!    made the system default for everything so that one program can reach it.
//! 2. **The graph itself**, through `wpctl`, when the bridge will not take it.
//!
//! Only names are listed here. Deciding what to *do* with a node — which the
//! engine opens, in what order — is the caller's, and the same fallback story
//! runs there for a node as it does for a card.
